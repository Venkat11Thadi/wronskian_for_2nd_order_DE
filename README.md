# Wronskian_for_2nd_order_DE

I tried to calculate the wronskian value for the solutions of a 2nd order differential equation.
Interestingly we get non-zero values everytime and solutions of 2nd order DE are always linearly indepentent.
In the following code we can only calculate for 2nd order homogeneous DE.
